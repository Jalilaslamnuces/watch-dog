# Understanding ReadDirectoryChangesW - Part 1:
# http://qualapps.blogspot.com/2010/05/understanding-readdirectorychangesw.html
#
# Tim Golden's Implementation:
# http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/watch_directory_for_changes.html
#
# Notes:
# ------
# This implementation spawns an emitter worker thread that calls
# ReadDirectoryChangesW for each directory that needs to be monitored.
# Events are pooled into an event queue by each emitter worker thread.
# These events are consumed by an observer thread and dispatched to
# the appropriate specified event handler.
